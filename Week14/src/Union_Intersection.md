### Notes on Interfaces and Types in TypeScript

#### Behavior of Interfaces and Types
- Interfaces and types in TypeScript behave differently than one might initially expect.
- Specifically, intersections and unions in interfaces may not behave as intuitively as they seem:
  - **Intersection** in interfaces can feel more like a union.

#### Understanding TypeScript Types as Sets of Values
- In TypeScript, types represent **sets of values**.
- For example:
  ```typescript
  type Baby = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  };
  ```
  - The `Baby` type represents a set of values where all objects with at least `name` and `age` are valid.
  - Additional properties are allowed, meaning the type encompasses:
    - `{ name: string; age: number }`
    - `{ name: string; age: number; car: string }`
    - `{ name: string; age: number; dance: boolean }`
    - `{ name: string; age: number; modelname: string; insurance: boolean }`

- Similarly:
  ```typescript
  type Car = {
    modelname: string;
    insurance: boolean;
  };
  ```
  - The `Car` type represents a set of values where all objects with at least `modelname` and `insurance` are valid.
  - Additional properties are also allowed.

#### Intersection of Types
- When intersecting two types, the resulting type includes all required properties from both types.
- For example:
  ```typescript
  type BabyCar = Baby & Car;
  ```
  - The `BabyCar` type would include:
    - `{ name: string; age: number; modelname: string; insurance: boolean }`
  - This behavior might seem counterintuitive at first, as it appears to combine properties rather than restrict them.
  - However, this aligns with TypeScript's underlying behavior of treating types as sets of values.

#### Key Takeaway
- Understanding that TypeScript types are sets of values helps clarify why intersections behave the way they do.
- Intersections result in a type that satisfies all constraints from the intersected types, allowing for additional properties as long as the required ones are present.
- This behavior is consistent with TypeScript's design principles.
